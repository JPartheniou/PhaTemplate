Enables multilingual framework for plugin "WooCommerce - excelling eCommerce".

## Description ##

This plugin enables [qTranslate-X](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/) multilingual framework (version 3.1 or later) for WordPress plugin [WooCommerce - excelling eCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) (version 2.3.5 or later).

After the activation, depending on your theme, you may need to do the following additional step to finalize the configuration:

* In all customizable template files, replace calls to `bloginfo('xxx')` with `bloginfo('xxx','display')`, if you have any. You do not have to do this, if title of your blog appears correctly everywhere you can see it (especially in emails sent), or if you do not localize the name of your blog.

This plugin is not supported by the authors on the WordPress forum due to its simplicity. If you find a field which is not translatable, follow the pattern how it is done in the code for other fields and make it translatable. Then submit a pull request at [GitHub](https://github.com/qTranslate-Team/woocommerce-qtranslate-x) to enable your changes for everyone else.

## Installation ##

## Upgrade Notice ##

No need for Upgrade Notice.

## Known Issues ##
* Admin e-mails sent by pressing one of the buttons in column 'Actions' on order list page, `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=shop_order`, go in the original customer language used to submit the order. However, same e-mails sent using the "Resend order emails" option in order editor page, `/wp-admin/post.php?post=nnn&action=edit`, go in the mixed  language of admin and customer. As a workaround, you can switch the admin language to the customer language before resending an e-mail (which shouldn't happen too often).
* Two buttons, "Add New XXX" and "Search XXX", on attribute editor page, `/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=xxx&post_type=product`, are displayed with raw multilingual text. This should be fixed with a later qTranslate-X version.
* HTML header title on admin page `/wp-admin/edit-tags.php?taxonomy=xxx&post_type=product` displays raw multilingual values.
