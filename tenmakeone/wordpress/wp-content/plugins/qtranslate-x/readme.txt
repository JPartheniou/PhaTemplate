Adds user-friendly multilingual content management and translation support. It is an up-to-date fork of qTranslate with many additional features.

## Description ##

This plugin is a descendant of [qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/ "Original qTranslate plugin"), which has apparently been abandoned by the original author, [Qian Qin](http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/ "the original author of qTranslate"). 

While the back-end database framework is left almost intact, the design of editors is drastically changed and improved to be much less vulnerable to WP updates. Instead of seeing multiple lines per each language for title, qTranslate-X provides language switching buttons, which, once pressed, make all the text fields to be filled with the language chosen. The instant language change happens locally in your browser without sending an additional request to the server.

qTranslate-X makes creation of multilingual content as easy as working with a single language. Here are some features:

- One-click local switching between the languages - Changing the language as easy as switching between Visual and HTML.
- Language customizations without changing the .mo files - It stores all the translations in the same post fields, while shows it to user for editing one by one depending on the language to edit chosen.
- In-line syntax '`<!--:en-->English Text<!--:--><!--:de-->Deutsch<!--:-->`' or '`[:en]English Text[:de]Deutsch[:]`' for theme-custom fields gets them translated. See [FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/faq/ "qTranslate-X FAQ") for more information.
- Starting from release 3.1 encoding like this '`[:en]English Text[:de]Deutsch`' may also have closing tag `[:]`, which makes the example looks like this: '`[:en]English Text[:de]Deutsch[:]`'. The advantage of this is that one now can encode strings like this '`[:en]English Text[:]<html-language-neutral-code>[:de]Deutsch[:]<another-html-language-neutral-code>`', with language-neutral text embedded. Closing tag is not required, but if it is absent and multilingual text happened to be used embedded within other language-neutral text, then a part of language-neutral text will be recognized as language-specific text and may be removed by translator. That was a common incompatibility issue with other plugins, which is now resolved. Comment-like encoding `<!--:-->` still works as well, and can be used if desired, but it does not have any feasible advantage over `[:]`-style.
- Multilingual dates out of the box - translates dates and time for you.
- Theme custom fields can be configured to be translatable too.
- Comes with a number of languages already built-in - English, German, Simplified Chinese, for example, and many more.
- Choose one of 3 Modes to make your URLs look pretty and SEO-friendly. - The simple and beautiful `/en/foo/`, or nice and neat `en.yoursite.com`, and everywhere compatible `?lang=en`.
- One language for each URL - Users and SEO will thank you for not mixing multilingual content.
- qTranslate-X supports unlimited number of languages, which can be easily added/modified/deleted via a comfortable Configuration Page at Settings->Languages.
- Custom CSS for "qTranslate Language Chooser" widget configurable via its properties.
- Menu item "Language Switcher" to enable language choosing from a menu.
- Use [Google XML Sitemaps v3 for qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-xml-sitemaps-v3-for-qtranslate/) plugin to rebuild your XML sitemap for better SEO support.

The website [qTranslate-X explained](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/about/) provides and keeps updated a few useful listings:

- The [list of plugins, which provide integration](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/integrated-plugins/) of qTranslate-X with other popular plugins.
- The [list of some plugins reported to be compatible](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/compatible/) with qTranslate-X without an additional integrating plugin.
- The [list of some plugins reported not to be currently compatible](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/incompatible/) with qTranslate-X.

If you encounter a conflicting plugin, please [let us know](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/contact-us/), and meanwhile try to use other plugin of similar functionality, if possible.

You may still find a lot of useful information through reading [qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/ "Original qTranslate plugin")'s original documentation, which is not duplicated here in full. There are also other plugins, which offer multilingual support, but it seems that Qian Qin has very good original back-end design, and many people have been pleasantly using his plugin ever since. It stores all translations in the same single post, which makes it easy to maintain and to use it with other plugins. However, the user interface of former qTranslate got out of sync with the recent versions of Wordpress, especially after WP went to TinyMCE 4. There is a number of forks of qTranslate, see for example, [mqTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mqtranslate/ "mqTranslate plugin"), [qTranslate Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-xp/ "qTranslate Plus plugin") and [zTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/ "zTranslate plugin"). They all try to fix qTranslate's user interface preserving its original back-end, which is what this plugin does too. This plugin is a hybrid of all of them and fixes a few bugs in each of them. It also has many new features too, like theme custom translatable fields, for example. We hope that this plugin is the most complete working version which combines the best features of [qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/ "Original qTranslate plugin"), [mqTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mqtranslate/ "mqTranslate fork"), [qTranslate Plus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-xp/ "qTranslate Plus fork") and [zTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/ "zTranslate fork").

We organized an anonymous entity [qTranslate Team](https://github.com/qTranslate-Team) to maintain a joint authority of all qTranslate-ish plugins. Anyone is welcome to join with a contribution. Participating plugin authors should share the support efforts for each other.

1. Upgrading from [qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/ "qTranslate original plugin") required no additional actions, qTranslate-X will continue to work from the database entries of qTranslate. Upgrading from other qTranslate forks may require re-configuration of the languages and taxonomies names, unless you rename corresponding database entries directly.
1. **Important**: Read [migration instructions](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/migration-from-other-multilingual-plugins/), if you previously used other multilingual plugin.

For the new installers, it may be useful to read [Start-up Guide](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/startup-guide/).

It is important to read [migration instructions](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/migration-from-other-multilingual-plugins/), if you previously used other multilingual plugin.

Developers: please drop new topics here, the text will be moved to [qTranslate-X explained](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/faq/ "qTranslate-X explained FAQ") at the time of the next release.

## Upgrade Notice ##

* Upgrading from [qTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/ "qTranslate original plugin") and [zTranslate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/ "zTranslate plugin") requires no additional actions, qTranslate-X will continue to work from the database entries of qTranslate. One may also go back to qTranslate at any time.
* Upgrading from other qTranslate forks also painless with an additional steps of configuration import and using 'Convert Database' option. One may also go back at any time using configuration export and 'Convert Database' option.
* Former page and post translations are untouched and preserved in any case, except when using 'Convert Database' option.
* Upgrading from other multilingual frameworks will require custom re-configuration. We suggest to search for a plugin, which may be already implemented to transfer the translations to qTranslate or to qTranslate-X. If a plugin works for one, it should work for other too, since qTranslate-X and qTranslate share the same database structures.
* **Important**: read [migration instructions](https://qtranslatexteam.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/migration-from-other-multilingual-plugins/).

## Screenshots ##

1. Editing screen showing the buttons to switch the languages. Pressing a button does not make a call to the server, the editing happens locally, until "Update" button is pressed, the same way as it is for one language.
